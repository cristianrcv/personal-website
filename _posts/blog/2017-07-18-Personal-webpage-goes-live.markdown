Finally the first stable version of my personal webpage goes live!
</p>
<p align="justify">
I must highlight that I have never been nor a Web programmer nor a Designer, so this has ridiculously taken a large amount of time from me. I apologise if you find any broken link, unavailable image, unreadable text, etc. but I am still learning how it works. In fact, this webpage is based on the <a href="https://github.com/bawn92/sleek_blog" target="_blank">Sleek Blog</a> by bawn92.

This said, I must recommend this solution for people like me since I find it very comfortable, and there are lots of other templates if you don't like this one. Currently, I am using Netlify for hosting and continous building, and Jekyll and Gulp for development. The webpage is fully synchronized with a GitHub project (if you are really interested you can check it out at my <a href="https://github.com/cristianrcv/personal-webpage" target="_blank">GitHub Personal Webpage Project</a>) that Netlify builds whenever something new is commited. Amazing!

Please feel free to leave any comment or improvement but be benevolent since its my first personal webpage =D
